# To-Do List 

For creating the "Meteor Mosh Pit" Asteroids game using C++ in Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition, with the Microsoft Unit Testing Framework for Test-Driven Development (TDD) and SFML for game rendering:

---

## 1. Project Setup:

- [x] Create a new C++ project in Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition.
- [ ] Set up the project directory structure.
- [x] Integrate SFML into your project for game rendering.

## 2. Player Spaceship:

- [ ] Design and implement the player's spaceship class, allowing movement and rotation.
- [ ] Write unit tests using the Microsoft Unit Testing Framework for spaceship movement and rotation.
- [ ] Refactor and adjust as needed based on TDD results.

## 3. Shooting Mechanics:

- [ ] Implement shooting mechanics for the player's spaceship, allowing it to shoot projectiles.
- [ ] Write unit tests for projectile firing and movement.
- [ ] Refine the implementation based on TDD feedback.

## 4. Asteroid Generation:

- [ ] Generate asteroids of varying sizes and velocities at random positions.
- [ ] Implement asteroid movement and wrapping around the screen.
- [ ] Create unit tests for asteroid generation and movement.
- [ ] Iterate on the code based on TDD outcomes.

## 5. QuadTree Implementation:

- [ ] Design and implement a QuadTree data structure for efficient collision detection.
- [ ] Write unit tests to ensure the QuadTree's correctness.
- [ ] Integrate QuadTree into collision detection for asteroids and projectiles.
- [ ] Refactor and optimize as needed while maintaining TDD practices.

## 6. Collision Detection:

- [ ] Implement collision detection between the player's spaceship and asteroids using the QuadTree.
- [ ] Handle collision events, such as spaceship destruction and asteroid splitting.
- [ ] Write unit tests to verify collision detection logic.
- [ ] Continuously run tests and refine the code based on TDD results.

## 7. User Interface:

- [ ] Design and create a game menu with options to start, pause, and restart the game.
- [ ] Display player score, remaining lives, and game over screen.
- [ ] Implement unit tests for UI elements and interactions.
- [ ] Ensure UI components are functioning correctly with TDD iterations.

## 8. Sound Effects and Music:

- [ ] Integrate sound effects for shooting, collisions, and other game events.
- [ ] Add background music using SFML's audio features.
- [ ] Write unit tests to validate audio integration and synchronization.
- [ ] Adjust audio settings based on TDD feedback.

## 9. Particle Effects:

- [ ] Implement particle effects for explosions when asteroids are destroyed.
- [ ] Create a particle system for the spaceship's engine thrust.
- [ ] Write unit tests to ensure particle effects are triggered and displayed correctly.
- [ ] Refine particle effects based on TDD outcomes.

## 10. Polishing and Optimization:

- [ ] Fine-tune spaceship controls, asteroid generation rates, and game difficulty.
- [ ] Optimize code for performance, especially in the QuadTree and collision detection.
- [ ] Run profiling and ensure smooth gameplay with TDD-guided adjustments.

## 11. Game Over and Restart:

- [ ] Implement a game-over condition when the player loses all lives.
- [ ] Allow players to restart the game or return to the main menu.
- [ ] Write unit tests for game over scenarios and restart functionality.
- [ ] Iterate on the implementation using TDD principles.

## 12. Testing and Debugging:

- [ ] Continuously test and debug the entire game to identify and fix bugs.
- [ ] Perform thorough playtesting to ensure gameplay is enjoyable and smooth.
- [ ] Use unit tests as part of your debugging process to catch regressions.

## 13. Documentation:

- [ ] Write detailed wiki to explain complex logic and design choices.
- [ ] Create a README with instructions for building, running, and testing the game.
- [ ] Document the unit tests, their purpose, and expected behavior.

## 14. Extra Features (Optional):

- [ ] Add power-ups with corresponding unit tests.
- [ ] Implement different types of asteroids with unique behaviors, and write tests accordingly.
- [ ] Integrate high-score tracking and display, accompanied by unit tests.
